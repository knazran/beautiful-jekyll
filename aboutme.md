### Why Data Science? And why this blog?

I graduated with a Bachelors in Computer Science and Economics. I did courses in Econometrics, I know Python, I learn about distributed systems, machine learning, and optimization, I'm working at a Central Bank. My background from these fields suits the multidisciplinary nature of Data Science which merges the fields of Statistics, Maths, and Computer science to solve domain specific problems in virtually any industry nowadays. 

With the demand of talents capable of utilizing the huge amount of data available nowadays, I want to jump into the bandwagon.

This blog is meant to be a documentation of my journey and to share my learnings on Data Sciences. Especially in Malaysia where the field is at nascent stage, I want to help the talent ecosystem and help my fellow aspring data scientists at their journey.
