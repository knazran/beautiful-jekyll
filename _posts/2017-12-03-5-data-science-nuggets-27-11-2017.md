I always have trouble writing coherent paragraphs at the end of the day. And most days, I'll be writing on my phone after office hours and gym and trust me when I say this, I am not the most eloquent during this time. But I would like to share whatever I have learned through the week and sometimes these learning are not really worth an entire post dedicated to them.

Then it hits me, these are what I like to call 'little nuggets of knowledge' which are useful FYIs to consume (and write) at leisure just like actual nuggets.
